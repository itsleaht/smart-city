Based in Vancouver, an architect’s cabinet imagined a building who generates its own custom-made climate, without polluting. But how do the hotel regulate its temperature? To create a microclimate in the outside periphery of the hotel, the architects equipped the rails with reflective panels sending the heat and the light towards the ground by concentrating them at the most. These eco-responsible constructions are designed to store a maximum of energy. The tours distribute massively heat and light in each part of the complex."

Why should we use AI? First of all, AI systems are flexible and they can do more work, be in more places, than humans. Sources are disparate. That’s where autonomous systems come in.Imagine, renewable energies such as solar and wind, which have the advantage of being carbon-free and ubiquitous. Situated in villages and towns, those energies are just where local people needs them the most. AI can optimize those energies, and make them decentralized, autonomous. Similarly, AI will allow for a more decentralized water system, driven by sensors and new technologies like blockchain. In short, AI can deal with the intermittency of renewables, optimize them an make them autonomous."

With the belief that self-driving cars will be fully dedicated to protecting their passengers. Even if the cars are smart and connected, doesn’t mean the people are smart and connected. This is why a laser projection from the car acts as a warning sign for cyclist and walkers. The roads will be illuminated as well and they will react to where people or cars are going to."

Imagine a 90 minutes road trip by car, who would take 8 minutes with an Uber air. The company already plans spreading between 500 and 1000 of these flying taxis in the congested megalopolises. To do this, Uber partners with NASA and the industrialists. They complete their first demonstrations in Dallas and in Dubai before 2020, and the first commercial flights before 2030."
