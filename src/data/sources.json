As the company explored how the paint could be used with autonomous cars–the paint could, for example, help a car recognize an intersection or lane, or provide markers that make GPS much more accurate–they realized that the paint could also be useful for people who are blind. The lines will be made of smart paint : nanocrystals that can emit a unique light signature, which a sensor added to the tip of a cane can activate and then read. ",

The paint could help someone identify, for example, if they are standing on the northwest or southwest corner of an intersection, or the exact location of an entrance to a building.
